            <h2 className="mt" >About</h2>
            <p> I am the lead for Medicines Information at North Middlesex University Hospital. I handle particularly complex enquiries that pharmacists would normally struggle to handle at ward level that require extensive research. My experience of hospital prescribing systems even at the biggest NHS Trusts has only been a frustrating one. I enrolled on Scrimba's frontend developer course and within 1 month I made the first working prototype of my Intravenous Iron calculator. I wish to make a version of it with react which hopefully will help format things better.
